      <p>I changed jobs so that I am now working part-time instead of full-time. This will allow me more time to focus on Lion Heart Heroes.</p> 
      <p>First order of business: a new look and new tag line. </p>

      <p>We partnered with Nick of Time Foundation to hold a screening at Kentwood High School on March 8th.  This is where David went to JROTC, so it was perfect for our inaugural screening event.  We screened 293 young people and found three with heart problems that needed follow-up.</p>
    <h3 class = "text-center">February 2017</h3>
      <p>Sometimes it feels like things are moving so slowly, but then suddenly, something breaks loose and events start happening at a rapid pace.  That's the way it's been this winter.  It took months to get approval to donate an AED to Naval Station Everett--we had to get permission from the Rear Admiral!  Then, the approval letter arrived, we bought the AED and we held the donation ceremony on February 24th at 11:00am.  </p>

      <h3 class = "text-center">Fall 2016</h3>
        <p>We attended the SADS (Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndromes) Conference in San Diego in early October. There we bought our first AED for the foundation!  The importance of being heart aware was driven home to us on our return flight when a young woman passed out and had no pulse.  Doctors on board revived her as we began our descent into Seattle, and it looked like she would recover.  It turns out she had taken cold medicines--which may have aggravated an underlying heart condition such as Long QT Syndrome.  We had just learned about that at the conference!</p>
        <p>In other news, the Marine Sudden Death Study did not get IRB (Institutional Review Board) approval because of issues related to consent, so the Navy is scaling it down to a smaller 'pilot' project.  We are working some other angles too and appreciate your support.</p>
