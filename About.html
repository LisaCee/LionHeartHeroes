    <p>Gold Star Families are those who have lost their loved ones in military service.  I became a Gold Star Mom on November 7, 2013 when my son, LCpl David Finlayson collapsed and died while on a five-mile training run with his battalion in Hawaii.  It’s still hard for me to believe that my strong and invincible 25-year-old son, in the peak of good health, could die from an undiagnosed heart problem.</p>

    <p>It turns out that heart problems are much more common than I knew.  “On average, a seemingly healthy young person suffers a sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) every three days in the US and it’s the leading cause of death in exercising young athletes. In most cases of sudden cardiac arrest, cardiac abnormalities are not detected, there are no warning signs, and unless a normal heart rhythm is restored within minutes, death is the end result.”  (See www.nickoftimefoundation.org)</p>

    <p>At first, they thought that David had an enlarged heart, which is a common cause of SCA.  But David had an athletic heart—it was big, but not defective.  His heart problem must have been electrical in nature—we may never know.   David had never had an electrocardiogram (ECG), which measures the electrical impulses of a beating heart.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class = "row">
  <div class = "col">
    <p>Several months after David died, another Gold Star Mom learned about the Nick of Time Foundation and volunteered to help screen students for heart problems at Meadowdale High School in Lynnwood, WA.  Matthew Truax, a student there, had died of SCA at age 16.  Matthew's mom, Melinda, started the Heart of Edmonds School District and Community Heart Safe Project, with the mission of putting an AED in every school in the Edmonds School District and having emergency plans in place.  The Nick of Time Foundation was started by Darla Varrenti and her sister, Sue Apodaca, after Darla’s son, Nick, died of SCA.  They have screened over 15,000 students since 2006 and discovered heart problems in more than 450 of them.  Of those, 98% have been able to participate in sports again after treatment.  John and I have since met these amazing women who have turned their tragedies into non-profit organizations that save lives. </p>

    <p>The mission of the Lion Heart Heroes Foundation is to promote heart health in our military community. Our objectives include raising awareness of SCA, encouraging the presence and quick use of AEDs, and advocating for cardiac screening of military recruits.  Eventually, we hope that research into heart screening will result in ECG screening becoming part of the medical requirements that take place at the Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS).  Let's discover these undiagnosed heart problems before young recruits join the service so that they can get them fixed.</p>

    <p>David already saved one life on that run in Hawaii.  After David died, another Marine in his battalion came forward and admitted to symptoms of dizziness and shortness of breath.  He was diagnosed with a heart condition and was then medically discharged—alive.</p>

      <h4><strong>2013</strong><br></h4>
      <li>Our son David died of Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA) while on a 5-mile training run with his battalion in Hawaii.  The next days and weeks were a blur of family, friends, funerals and flowers.</li>

      <h4><strong>2014</strong></h4>
      <h6>January</h6>
      <li>After making it through the holidays, we started the new year wondering how to move forward through our grief toward something positive.</li>
      <li>We first heard about the Nick of Time Foundation (NoTF) from a friend whose niece goes to Meadowdale High School.   NoTF will be having a screening in February in memory of Matthew Truax, who died from SCA in September.</li>
      <li>At a luncheon at Joint Base Lewis-McChord (JBLM) on January 26, we spoke with the commander of the Marine Logistics Battalion about partnering with NoTF to bring cardiac screening to the Marine reservists.</li>

      <h6>March</h6>
      <li>On March 25, the Nick of Time Foundation folks (Darla and Sue) had a conference call with the command from JBLM, along with John and Laurie of the (future) Lion Heart Heroes Foundation, to discuss a cardiac screening at JBLM in January or February 2015.</li>

      <h6>May</h6>
      <li>John and Laurie volunteered for a NoTF cardiac screening at Decatur High School in Federal Way, Washington.  We were impressed with their organization and efficiency.</li>

      <h6>June and July</h6>
      <li>We met with Nick of Time Foundation to discuss partnering with them.  We also met with several state congressmen to express support for the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Awareness bill currently under consideration in Washington state.</li>

      <h6>August</h6>
      <li>Laurie got down to the serious business of learning how to start a non-profit corporation.</li>

      <h6>September</h6>
      <li>After a long struggle over what to name our corporation, we settled on the Lion Heart Heroes Foundation. We reserved the name with Washington Secretary of State and purchased a web domain name.</li>
      <li>The initial Board of Directors was formed, with Laurie Finlayson as the Executive Director, John Finlayson as the Treasurer, and Thomas Finlayson as the Secretary.</li>
      <li>Thomas created our fantastic logo using his lion tattoo.  (See "Why the Lion?")</li>

      <h6>October</h6>
      <li>We wrote the Articles of Incorporation and had our first board meeting to approve them.</li>
      <li>We sent in the paperwork and became officially incorporated on October 16, 2014.</li>
      <li>Lion Heart Heroes Foundation (LHHF) opened a bank account and started taking contributions.</li>
      <li>Our Facebook page launched on October 26 and gained 500 Likes by early November.</li>

      <h6>November</h6>
      <li>We ordered business cards and a bank deposit stamp, our first real expenses.</li>  
      <li>We launched the LionHeartHeroes.org web page.</li>
      <li>With the date of the JBLM screening drawing closer, we created a fundraising page on YouCaring.org to collect donations to cover the cardiac screening of 250 Marine reservists at $25 each.</li>
      <li>On November 28th, the Board of Directors approved Myra Rintamaki as a new board member.  Myra brings a wealth of experience and innumerable military connections to LHHF.  Additionally, she is the one who first had the vision of partnering with NoTF to bring cardiac screening to the military.  Welcome aboard, Myra!</li>

      <h6>Dece﻿mber</h6>
      <li>On December 5, Darla, Sue, and Steve from NoTF, and John, Laurie, and Myra from LHHF met with the new commander of the Marine Logistics Battalion, the Chief Medical Officer, the Sergeant Major and other Marines at JBLM to plan our inaugural cardiac screening on January 24th.</li>  
      <li>Application for 501(c)(3) tax exemption was filed with the IRS on December 6.</li>
      <li>John and Laurie traveled to Hawaii to welcome David's platoon home from deployment.</li>
      <li>On December 16, we got word from JBLM that the legal office for the Marine Corps Reserve in New Orleans would not give permission for our cardiac screening event at JBLM in January.  Laurie contacted JAG counsel who began working with BUMED, the Navy Bureau of Medicine, to resolve the issues. All communication was delayed by the holidays. </li>
